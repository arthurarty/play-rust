## How to compile
Assuming you have a file called 
```bash
rustc main.rs
```

## Run the program
```
./main
```

## Cargo.toml file
The Cargo.toml file is a configuration file that specifies various details about your Rust project. It includes information such as the project name, version, dependencies, build configuration, and more. Here are some key aspects of the Cargo.toml file:
- Project Metadata: Includes the project's name, version, authors, and other metadata.  
- Dependencies: Lists the external crates (libraries) that your project depends on.  
- Build Configuration: Specifies build-related settings and features.  
Example:
```toml
[package]
name = "my_rust_project"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]

[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
```

## Cargo.lock file
The Cargo.lock file is automatically generated by Cargo based on the dependencies specified in the Cargo.toml file. It records the exact versions of the dependencies (and their transitive dependencies) that were used when the project was last built.
